# Algorithmic Complexity

This application is an assignment from The algorithmic complexity course, the part of computer science that deals with how efficient programmes are.   
I have implemented a simple time framework app to check how much time algorithms takes to run and how they scale when dealing with increasing array sizes.  
The results are shown in a google sheet chart.
